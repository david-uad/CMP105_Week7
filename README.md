CMP105 Lab 7 projects

Lab sheet notes:
Code 7_1 :

There was a missing semicolon at the end of the Enemy header file, which caused the Player class which inherited from Enemy to cause compile time errors.
I used the debug output and knowledge of correct syntax to go through first the player class, and then its includes until I found the syntax error.


Code 7_2:

Another syntax error, this time in the player header file. A colon was missing after the 'private' identifier on line 17. Again the IDE debug output was used,
and the error was quickly located within player.h. Also of use was the IDE suggestion dialogue which made identifying the error much easier. There is also a
large discrepancy between what the program is supposed to do and what it actually doe, based on the lab notes, but I will assume this is intentional as it is not 
a bug.


Code 7_3:




Code 7_4: What was wrong? How did you fix it? and cruically what tools and techniques did you use to find it?


Code 7_5: What was wrong? How did you fix it? and cruically what tools and techniques did you use to find it?



Code 7_6: What was wrong? How did you fix it? and cruically what tools and techniques did you use to find it?


Code 7_7: What was wrong? How did you fix it? and cruically what tools and techniques did you use to find it?
