Lab sheet notes:
Code 7_1 :

There was a missing semicolon at the end of the Enemy header file, which caused the Player class which inherited from Enemy to cause compile time errors.
I used the debug output and knowledge of correct syntax to go through first the player class, and then its includes until I found the syntax error.
